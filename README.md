</br></br>
This is a mini-project made by Priyansh Sultania </br>
New-Concepts used: </br>
<b>MVVM Architecture:</b> Which helps making an app scalable </br>
<b>Offline-Database:</b> Which can store data when user if offline or battery is low. </br>
This function is needed when user is offline so that his/her data can be store in local device and can be sent to the server when he is online.</br>
<b>CustomAdapter:</b> Though this is not a new concept but it was worth mentioning here as I used it first-time in this scale.

<b>Note:</b> This is just a Mini-Project. All the concepts used here can be used with conepts used in other mini-project with all the combination possible.
